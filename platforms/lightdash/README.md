# Lightdash

[Lightdash](https://www.lightdash.com/) is an open-source BI tool connected to your team's Snowflake database. Use it to build dashboards and visualisations for your analysis and final presentation.

The recommended workflow: set up a dbt project, deploy it to Lightdash via the CLI, then use **Explore** to build charts and dashboards from your models' dimensions and metrics.

## AI-assisted Lightdash development

This repo includes a **Lightdash skill** (`.claude/skills/developing-in-lightdash/`) that lets you describe what you want in plain language and have your AI assistant generate the configuration.

The skill can:

- Add **metrics and dimensions** to your dbt models (Lightdash meta properties)
- Create **charts** (bar, line, pie, table, big number, funnel, and more) as code
- Build **dashboards** combining multiple charts with filters
- Handle the full `lightdash deploy` / `lightdash download` / `lightdash upload` workflow

**Example:** Tell your AI assistant _"I want a bar chart showing top 10 streaming providers by clickout count, broken down by country"_ — it will create the dbt model with the right Lightdash metadata, deploy it, and generate the chart.

## Quick start

1. Get the Lightdash CLI working — see [setup.md](setup.md)
2. Deploy your dbt project to Lightdash
3. Use AI skills or the Lightdash UI to build explores and dashboards

Oli from Lightdash will give a live demo during the kickoff.
